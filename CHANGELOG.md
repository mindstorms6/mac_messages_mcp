# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Fork: `tool_mark_read` opens an exact existing conversation in Messages and verifies incoming read state using read-only database queries. Ambiguous targets and unconfirmed updates fail explicitly; no SIP changes, private framework injection, or database writes are required. Includes side-effect annotations and regression tests.

### Security
- GitHub Actions workflows now declare read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions at the workflow level and grant write scopes only on the jobs that upload SARIF, submit SBOMs, comment on PRs, or publish releases.
- Contact/message text cleaning no longer uses a regex character class spanning U+24C2–U+1F251, which CodeQL flagged as an overly permissive range and which also stripped CJK.
- The MCPB builder fetches `uv` over HTTPS with an allowlisted redirect host set instead of `urllib.request.urlopen`.
- Added a bounded Atheris harness for phone/handle parsers (`fuzz/fuzz_phone.py`).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-01

### Security
- MCP tool and resource output derived from Messages and Contacts is serialized at a single untrusted-output boundary (`present_untrusted_output`). Newlines become the literal two-character sequence `\n`; invisible, bidi, and format Unicode is escaped; fence terminators inside content are defanged; and the payload is wrapped in `<untrusted-mcp-output>` so it is not treated as instructions. Fence idempotence uses an in-process marker, so attacker text that only looks already-fenced is still re-serialized. This is not an anti-injection guarantee.
- Clients must still gate `tool_send_message`. The locked `mcp` 1.3.0 FastMCP API has no elicitation, and a `confirm=True` argument is not human confirmation.
- Coordinated reports from Grégoire Compagnon (obeone) prompted this output-boundary work.
- CodeQL actions are pinned to commit SHAs and analyze Python with `security-extended` queries. Dependabot covers the `uv` and `github-actions` ecosystems. A Semgrep OSS scan (`semgrep scan` in the official `semgrep/semgrep` image) replaced the unused GitHub-starter Semgrep workflow that required `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN`.

### Added
- Added `MAC_MESSAGES_REGION` to override the region used when parsing national-format numbers, for Macs configured for a different region than their phone numbers belong to.
- Added `phonenumbers` as a dependency, replacing the hand-rolled country-code heuristics.

### Fixed
- Phone numbers written in national format are now expanded to E.164 against the region the Mac is configured for instead of being assumed North American. A French number such as `06 39 98 00 01` was previously turned into `+10639980001`, which made contact listings show the wrong country code and made message lookups, attachment lookups and iMessage availability checks miss handles that exist in the database.
- Handle matching now compares numbers on their canonical E.164 form, so an E.164 input finds a handle stored in national format and the reverse. Lookups that find nothing through the indexed query fall back to a canonical scan of the handle table.
- `_looks_like_phone_input` accepts dot separators, so `05.39.98.00.03` is treated as a phone number rather than a contact name.
- Address book entries whose number cannot be read as a phone number, such as SMS short codes, entries carrying a trailing label, and foreign numbers saved without their `+`, keep a digits-only key instead of being dropped from the contacts map. Contact name resolution looks up the canonical form, the digits, and the national number, so both sides of the comparison meet whichever form the entry was stored under.
- The region is read from a macOS regional override when there is one. A Mac running in English with its Region set to France reports `en_US@rg=frzzzz`, whose effective region is France rather than the United States, and its national numbers were still being given a `+1`.
- Email handles are compared case-insensitively on both sides, so an address stored in mixed case is found whichever way it is typed.
- Email addresses are looked up as handles instead of being sent to fuzzy contact-name matching, which answered "No contacts found" for any address that is not in the address book and returned before the handle query could run.
- Recipients are refused for being dialable only from inside their own local area rather than for having fewer than ten digits. The digit floor rejected every numbering plan shorter than the North American one, an eight-digit Norwegian number among them, while still letting through the seven-digit North American local form it was meant to catch. Several numbering plans consider a short national form possible, a seven-digit North American local among them, so a half-typed number was being expanded and handed to Messages.app.

### Changed
- Upgraded Pillow from 12.2.0 to 12.3.0.
- Updated indirect dependencies: python-dotenv 1.2.2, idna 3.15, and pygments 2.20.0.
- GitHub Actions: `actions/checkout` v7.0.1 (SHA-pinned), `astral-sh/setup-uv` v10, and `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` 1.14.2.
- CI jobs now set `timeout-minutes` so a stuck macOS runner acquire fails closed.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- Added production macOS CI across Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 with formatting, typing, distribution-build, clean-wheel-install, and MCPB architecture checks.
- Added structured GitHub issue forms and a pull-request template with validation and privacy prompts.
- Added complete setup guidance for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, VS Code, and other stdio MCP clients.
- Added focused regression coverage for Messages and AddressBook database access failures.

### Changed
- Declared the project production-stable and established the first supported `1.x` compatibility contract.
- Replaced the interactive regex-based version script with an atomic, non-interactive UV-backed workflow that synchronizes `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and `manifest.json`.
- Made releases idempotent and reviewable: merged version changes are validated, published to PyPI through OIDC trusted publishing, annotated with a Git tag, and published as a GitHub release.
- Reworked the README around an install, permissions, client configuration, verification, privacy, and troubleshooting flow.

### Security
- Hardened local database access with SQLite read-only mode and `query_only` enforcement.
- Bounded and sanitized message output, escaped AppleScript inputs, and added execution timeouts around Messages automation.
- Kept attachment discovery metadata-first, with explicit fetches and size limits for inline images.
- Preserved tokenless PyPI publishing; no long-lived package index credential is stored in GitHub.

### Fixed
- Normalized direct phone recipients to reliable E.164 values and improved contact result formatting.
- Improved group-chat filtering, attachment handling, package installation verification, and permission diagnostics.

### Compatibility
- No intentional breaking Python or MCP tool API changes were introduced from 0.9.2; `1.0.0` marks the stable support boundary.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- Added `chat_id` filtering to `tool_get_recent_messages` for group conversations returned by `tool_get_chats`.

### Fixed
- Normalized phone recipients to send-ready E.164-style values before dispatching to Messages.
- Made fuzzy contact lookup return send-ready phone numbers with a leading `+`.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- Added `glama.json` metadata for Glama server ownership and profile completion.

### Changed
- Expanded MCP tool descriptions and parameter schemas with permissions, side-effect, return-shape, and tool-selection guidance.
- Updated Claude Desktop extension metadata to match the current package version.
- Modernized package license metadata to avoid setuptools deprecation warnings.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- Added message attachment discovery, metadata search, and attachment fetching.
- Added Claude Desktop Extension packaging metadata.
- Added Dockerfile and packaging documentation for catalog and local inspection workflows.

### Fixed
- Hardened message output rendering for control characters, embedded newlines, and oversized message bodies.
- Resolved outstanding pull requests and issue-reported test coverage gaps.

## [0.7.0] - 2024-12-28

### 🚀 MAJOR FEATURE: SMS/RCS Fallback Support

This release adds automatic SMS/RCS fallback when recipients don't have iMessage, solving the "Not Delivered" problem for Android users and significantly improving message delivery reliability.

### Added
- **Automatic SMS/RCS Fallback**: Messages automatically fall back to SMS when iMessage is unavailable
- **iMessage Availability Checking**: New `tool_check_imessage_availability` MCP tool to check recipient capabilities
- **Enhanced Message Sending**: Improved AppleScript logic with built-in fallback detection
- **Clear Service Feedback**: Users are informed whether message was sent via iMessage or SMS
- **Android Compatibility**: Now works seamlessly with Android users and non-iMessage contacts

### Enhanced
- **Message Sending Logic**: Enhanced `_send_message_direct()` with automatic fallback
- **AppleScript Integration**: Improved error handling and service detection
- **User Experience**: Significantly reduced "Not Delivered" errors
- **Debugging Support**: Better visibility into delivery methods and failures

### New Functions
- `_check_imessage_availability()`: Check if recipient has iMessage available
- `_send_message_sms()`: Direct SMS sending function with proper error handling
- Enhanced fallback logic in existing message sending functions

### New MCP Tool
- `tool_check_imessage_availability`: Check recipient iMessage status with clear feedback
  - ✅ Shows iMessage available
  - 📱 Shows SMS fallback available
  - ❌ Shows when neither service is available

### Technical Implementation
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects phone numbers vs email addresses
- **Service Prioritization**: Tries iMessage first, falls back to SMS for phone numbers
- **Group Chat Handling**: Maintains iMessage-only for group chats (SMS doesn't support groups well)
- **Error Differentiation**: Distinguishes between iMessage and SMS delivery failures

### Testing
- Added `test_sms_fallback_functionality()` to integration test suite
- Validates new SMS functions don't crash with import errors
- Ensures proper exception handling for AppleScript operations
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Use Cases Solved
- **Android Users**: Messages now deliver automatically via SMS instead of failing
- **Mixed Contacts**: Seamless experience across iMessage and SMS contacts
- **Delivery Troubleshooting**: Can check iMessage availability before sending
- **Reduced Friction**: No manual intervention needed for cross-platform messaging

### Migration Notes
Users upgrading from 0.6.7 will immediately benefit from:
1. **Improved Delivery**: Messages to Android users work automatically
2. **Better Feedback**: Clear indication of delivery method used
3. **New Debugging**: Check iMessage availability proactively
4. **Fewer Errors**: Significantly reduced "Not Delivered" messages

This release makes Mac Messages MCP truly universal - working seamlessly with both iMessage and SMS/RCS recipients.

## [0.6.7] - 2024-12-19

### 🚨 CRITICAL FIXES
- **FIXED**: Added missing `from thefuzz import fuzz` import that caused fuzzy search to crash with NameError
- **FIXED**: Corrected timestamp conversion from seconds to nanoseconds for Apple's Core Data format
- **FIXED**: Added comprehensive input validation to prevent integer overflow crashes
- **FIXED**: Improved contact selection validation with better error messages

### Added
- Input validation for negative hours (now returns helpful error instead of processing)
- Maximum hours limit (87,600 hours / 10 years) to prevent integer overflow
- Comprehensive integration tests to catch runtime failures
- Better error messages for invalid contact selections
- Validation for fuzzy search thresholds (must be 0.0-1.0)
- Empty search term validation for fuzzy search

### Fixed
- **Message Retrieval**: Fixed timestamp calculation that was causing most time ranges to return no results
- **Fuzzy Search**: Fixed missing import that caused crashes when using fuzzy message search
- **Integer Overflow**: Fixed crashes when using very large hour values
- **Contact Selection**: Fixed misleading error messages for invalid contact IDs
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error message format across all functions

### Changed
- Timestamp calculation now uses nanoseconds instead of seconds (matches Apple's format)
- Error messages now consistently start with "Error:" for better user experience
- Contact selection validation is more robust and provides clearer guidance

### Technical Details
This release fixes catastrophic failures discovered through real-world testing:
- Message retrieval was returning 6 messages from a year of data due to incorrect timestamp format
- Fuzzy search was completely non-functional due to missing import
- Large hour values caused integer overflow crashes
- Invalid inputs were accepted then caused crashes instead of validation errors

### Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backward compatible while fixing broken functionality.

## [0.6.6] - 2024-12-18

### Issues Identified (Fixed in 0.6.7)
- Missing `thefuzz` import causing fuzzy search crashes
- Incorrect timestamp calculation causing poor message retrieval
- No input validation causing integer overflow crashes
- Inconsistent error handling and misleading error messages
